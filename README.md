The project is built with React.js and uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design. For state management, I used Context API and Reducer, and I integrated two APIs, ["Swap Zone API"](https://swapzone.io/partners/exchange-api) and ["Coin Rank API"](https://developers.coinranking.com/api) to interact with the backend and display data.
